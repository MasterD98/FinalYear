        <h3><b>What is Skin Cancer</b></h3> <br>
        <img class="skin-image" src="./assets/imgs/skin.jpg" alt="skin">
        <p>
            Skin cancer is the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the epidermis, the outermost skin layer,
            caused by unrepaired DNA damage that triggers mutations. These mutations lead the skin cells to multiply
            rapidly and form malignant tumors.
            <br>
            <br>
            The two main causes of skin cancer are the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and the use of UV tanning
            beds. The good news is that if skin cancer is caught early, your dermatologist can treat it with little or
            no scarring and high odds of eliminating it entirely. Often, the doctor may even detect the growth at a
            precancerous stage, before it has become a full-blown skin cancer or penetrated below the surface of the
            skin.
        </p><br>
        <h3><b>Symptoms</b></h3> <br>
        <p>
            Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck,
            chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of
            day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area. <br><br>
            Skin cancers aren’t all identical, and they may not cause many symptoms. Still, unusual changes to your skin
            can be a warning sign for the different types of cancer. Being alert for changes to your skin may help you
            get a diagnosis earlier. <br> <br>
            Watch out for symptoms, including: <br>

        <h3><b>Common Types of Skin Cancers</b></h3> <br>
        <img class="types-image" src="./assets/imgs/types.jpg" alt="types">
        <p>Basal and squamous cell skin cancers are the most common types of skin cancer. They start in the top layer of
            skin (the epidermis), and are often related to sun exposure.<br><br>
            Most common types of skin cancers are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Squamous cells:</b> These are flat cells in the upper (outer) part of the epidermis, which are
                constantly shed as new ones form. When these cells grow out of control, they can develop into squamous
                cell skin cancer (also called squamous cell carcinoma).</li>
            <li><b>Basal cells:</b> These cells are in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer.
                These cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off the skin’s
                surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells.
                Skin cancers that start in the basal cell layer are called basal cell skin cancers or basal cell
                carcinomas.</li>
            <li><b>Melanoma:</b>These cells make the brown pigment called melanin, which gives the skin its tan or brown
                color. Melanin acts as the body’s natural sunscreen, protecting the deeper layers of the skin from some
                of the harmful effects of the sun. Melanoma skin cancer starts in these cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Other Types of Skin Cancers</b></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Kaposi Sarcoma</li>
            <li>Cutaneous (skin) Lymphoma</li>
            <li>Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma</li>
            <li>Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP)</li>
        </ul>

        <img class="bcc-image" src="./assets/imgs/bccc.png" alt="basal">
        <p>
            Basal cell carcinoma (also called basal cell skin cancer) is most common type of skin cancer. About 8 out of
            10 skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas (also called basal cell cancers). <br><br>

            These cancers start in the basal cell layer, which is the lower part of the epidermis.These cancers usually
            develop on sun-exposed areas, especially the face, head, and neck. They tend to grow
            slowly. It’s very rare for a basal cell cancer to spread to other parts of the body. But if it's left
            untreated, basal cell cancer can grow into nearby areas and invade the bone or other tissues beneath the
            skin.<br><br>

            If not removed completely, basal cell carcinoma can come back (recur) in the same place on the skin. People
            who have had basal cell skin cancers are also more likely to get new ones in other places.
